For this project I used Altium to create a schematic 
for a PCB that could control all the lights on the car. 
I then created the PCB layout


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Light Board PCB.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Light Board schematic.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Schematic and PCB Layout
</div>

After getting the board I had to check each pin for shorts and make sure everything was printed correctly. I then soldered the board and tested it before it was finally ready to go in the car.
