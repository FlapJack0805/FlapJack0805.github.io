For this project I used Altium to create a schematic 
for a PCB that could control all the lights on the car. 
I then created the PCB layout

Key features of the project include:

-PCB Design in Altium: I used Altium Designer to create a detailed and optimized PCB layout. This design included all necessary components to interface with the lighting system, ensuring proper power distribution, signal routing, and component placement.

-Lighting Control System: The PCB was designed to manage multiple lighting circuits on the car, including headlights, brake lights, turn signals, and interior lighting. It included necessary components like transistors and MOSFETs for switching the lights on and off.

-Power and Signal Integrity: Ensured that the power supplied to the lighting system was stable and that signals controlling the lights were routed without interference, maintaining high reliability under different operating conditions.

-Integration with Solar Car Systems: The PCB was designed to seamlessly integrate with the rest of the solar car's systems, ensuring that the lighting system worked efficiently alongside the vehicle's power management and control systems.

-Testing and Validation: I worked closely with the team to test the board in real-world conditions, ensuring that all lights performed reliably and that the PCB could handle the electrical demands of the vehicle.

Through this project, I developed several key skills:

-PCB Design with Altium: Gained hands-on experience designing PCBs in Altium, focusing on optimizing layouts, power management, and component selection for real-world applications.

-Power Electronics: Improved my understanding of power electronics, including switching and controlling high-current loads in automotive systems.

-Testing and Debugging: Refined my ability to test and troubleshoot complex electronic systems in a high-performance environment, ensuring reliability and efficiency.

This project provided valuable experience in PCB design, electrical system integration, and automotive lighting control and was a key contribution to the Michigan Solar Car team.
