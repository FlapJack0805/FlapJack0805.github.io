For this project, I developed an implementation of the popular card game Euchre in C++. The goal was to simulate the rules and gameplay mechanics of the game, allowing players to interact with the game through a simple player logic system.

The key aspects of this project included:

-Player Logic: I created a "Simple Player" that would follow specific strategies to play their cards. If a player could follow suit, they would play the highest card in their hand that matched the suit. Otherwise, they would play the lowest card in their hand.

-Game Mechanics: I implemented the core rules of Euchre, including card dealing, trump suit selection, and scoring. This involved managing player hands, the deck, and the state of each round.

-Game Flow: The program handled the flow of multiple rounds, including determining the winning player based on the hand played and updating the score after each round.

Through this project, I improved my skills in:

-Game Logic and Algorithms: Understanding how to structure a game and develop algorithms for decision-making (like the Simple Player's strategy).

-C++ Programming: Enhancing my skills in C++ through object-oriented design, managing game state, and handling user input/output.

-Testing and Debugging: Ensuring the game followed all rules accurately and was free of bugs through extensive testing.
This project was both a fun challenge and a great way to apply my knowledge of algorithms, C++, and game design.
