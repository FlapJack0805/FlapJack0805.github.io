For this project I used c++ to program an image resizer. Utilizing a seam carving algorithm this project allows you to shrink images vertically and horizontally.




<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-12 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/imageresizer.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Through this project I learned a lot of important skills such as learning a seam carving algorithm. I also explored techniques like energy mapping, dynamic programming, and seam finding, which are core to optimizing image resizing without distorting important content. All in all the project turned out great successfully being able to efficently resize images.
