For this project, I designed a four-function calculator using Verilog, capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The goal was to create a simple yet effective calculator that could handle basic arithmetic operations on 11-bit inputs.

Key features of the project include:

-Verilog Design: I used Verilog to implement the calculator's logic, including modules for each arithmetic operation. The design is optimized for performance, with separate modules for each operation to ensure clarity and modularity.

-Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports four basic operations:
Addition and Subtraction using standard binary arithmetic.
Multiplication using a combination of shifts and adds to simulate multiplication.
Division based on a shift-and-subtract approach to handle integer division.

-User Input and Output: The calculator is designed to accept two 8-bit inputs and output the result of the selected operation.

-Through this project, I developed several key skills:

-Hardware Description Languages (HDL): Gained hands-on experience in Verilog, specifically in designing combinational and sequential circuits for arithmetic operations.
Digital Logic Design: Strengthened my understanding of binary arithmetic and how to efficiently implement these operations at the hardware level.

-Optimization: Focused on optimizing the Verilog design for speed and accuracy, while ensuring that each operation module was reusable and well-organized.

-Simulation and Testing: Used testbenches to simulate and verify the behavior of the design, ensuring that edge cases and normal cases were handled correctly.

This project was an excellent opportunity to explore digital arithmetic and hardware design, and helped deepen my understanding of how complex operations are performed at the hardware level.
