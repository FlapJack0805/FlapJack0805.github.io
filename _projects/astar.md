For this project, I developed an interactive maze solver using Pygame that allows users to create custom mazes and visualize the pathfinding process using the A algorithm*. The program not only solves the maze but also visually demonstrates how the A* algorithm finds the most efficient path from start to finish.

Key features of the project include:

-Interactive Maze Creation: Users can create their own mazes by placing walls and defining start and end points directly in the graphical interface. This allows for an engaging and hands-on experience.

-A Pathfinding Algorithm: The core of the project is the A* algorithm, which efficiently finds the shortest path through the maze by considering both the current distance and an estimate of the remaining distance to the goal (using a heuristic).

-Visualizing the Algorithm: To help users understand how A* works, the program slows down the process, showing each step of the algorithm as it explores the maze, calculates paths, and finds the solution.

-Graphical Interface: Using Pygame, I created an intuitive graphical interface where users can interact with the maze and watch the A* algorithm in action, offering a clear visual representation of the algorithm's search process.

Through this project, I developed several key skills:

-Algorithm Implementation: Strengthened my understanding of the A* algorithm, including how to implement it efficiently and visualize its steps in real-time.

-Pygame Programming: Gained experience using Pygame to create interactive applications, focusing on user input, rendering, and game-like logic.

-Visualization Techniques: Enhanced my ability to present complex algorithms in an accessible and visually engaging manner, which is crucial for understanding computational concepts.

-Problem Solving: Fine-tuned my ability to tackle algorithmic challenges, optimize performance, and create intuitive user experiences.
This project was a great opportunity to explore pathfinding algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world scenarios, while also learning about visualization and user interaction.
