I'm Currently a junior in standing at the University of Michigan studying computer engineering. I've worked on everything from PCB design to software engineering. 

I have been able to gain experience through working with the University Solar Car Team, my classes, and passion projects. The top projects I've pursued are featured here on this website.

When I'm not doing work I enjoy weight lifting, watching sports, and playing guitar. Feel free to reach out to me through any of my socials linked below!
