I'm currently a junior in standing at the Univeristy of Michigan studying computer engineering. My interests include desinging embedded systems, embedded software engineering, and software engineering. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

When I'm not doing work I enjoy weight lifting, watching sports, and buidling personal projects.
